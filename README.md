# HotChocolateDemo
Just a demo project to learn GraphQL using C# and Hotchocolate in combination with Keycloak. 


In this project I tried to understand hotchocolate and how to implement a GraphQL-Server with it. I also tried to use subscription over websockets and authorize them through Jason Web Tokens.
In `HotChocolate/wwwroot` is a small VueJs app to get a token and to consume the service.
